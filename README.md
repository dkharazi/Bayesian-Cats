## Overview

A clinical trial was conducted by veterinarians specializing in feline internal medicine to determine the efficacy of a drug therapy for the treatment of erythrocytosis in cats. Erythrocytosis (or polycythemia) is defined by the increase in total red blood cells and is diagnosed through a complete blood cell count (CBC) test. The disease can be classified as either primary or secondary. A total of 40 cats were enrolled in the study. Half of these cats had previously been diagnosed with primary erythrocytosis (*Type* = 1) and the other half had been diagnosed with secondary erythrocytosis (*Type* = 0). The cats belong to one of 5 breeds (*Breed*); breeds A, B, and C are classified as domestic (*Domestic* = 1) and breeds D and E are classified as non-domestic (*Domestic* = 0). Each cat was given a specific dose (*Dose*) of the drug hydroxyurea for a period of 3 months. The veterinarians recorded the change in packed cell volume (Î”*PCV*) following treatment (the more negative, the better).

## Variable Descriptions

`DeltaPCV:` The cell volume that belongs to a cat.
- `Type:` The type of erythrocytosis sustained by a cat (Primary = 1; Secondary = 0).
- `Dose:` The dose of the drug hydroxyurea given to a cat.
- `Breed:` The breed of a cat (A,B,C = 1; D,E = 0).
